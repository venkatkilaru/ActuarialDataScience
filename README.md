We present three deterministic methods for estimating loss reserves: the chain ladder method, the Average Cost Per Claim method, and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method. The data used to implement these methods is the APRA claims data. The line of business chosen is the Compulsory Third Party (CTP) motor vehicle insurance which is a long-tail line of business.
